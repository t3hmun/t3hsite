# About

## Pre-emptive TLDR

Minimal Jekyll theme using HTML5, focused on readability and ease of editing; all the files are extensively commented.

I wrote a series of blog posts on the development of the theme, documenting what I learnt in a way that may be useful for other with basic web dev knowledge.

### Key Points 

 * Jekyll.
     - Kramdown with GFM (GitHub Markdown) mode.
     - Rouge for syntax highlighting.
 * Adapts perfectly to all screen sizes, without losing consistency of appearance.
 * Colours and sizes all edited via variables from master SASS file.
     - This means you don't have to trawl through mile of CSS to edit a colour or size.
     - Enforces consistency.
     - Easy to flip into a dark or other theme.
 * Not compatible for generating on GitHub pages (but fine to host on there).
     - This makes life a lot easier, less restrictions.


## Long Version

A long time ago I decided to create a personal blog hosted used GitHub pages.

At first I tried to modify themes made by others; it ended up looking awful and samey, the CSS was hard to reason and horrible to modify.

I saw responsive sites and marvelled at how they changed shape as I shrunk the browser window. 
Then I saw how ridiculous the CSS involved was. 
Then I realised good old word wrap does the job twice as well.

So I set out to write my own CSS and HTML, set  out with the basic template created by Jekyll and created. Create my [Rather Simple Jekyll Theme](http://t3hmun.github.io/rather-simple-jekyll-theme/)) but the CSS ended up a mess again - I had hardly written any real HTML or CSS before. I'd tried to work on top of Jekyll's default theme, which turned out to be less than ideal.

I decided to start again from scratch. So I made this site. Using obsessive documentation to justify everything, I managed to make something much more neat and maintainable. I've written the documenting blog posts as tutorials as this approach forces me to properly consider and justify everything I did.
