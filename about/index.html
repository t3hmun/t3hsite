<h3 id="pre-emptive-tldr">Pre-emptive TLDR</h3>

<p>Minimal Jekyll theme using HTML5, focused on readability and ease of editing; all the files are extensively commented.</p>

<p>I wrote a series of blog posts on the development of the theme, documenting what I learnt in a way that may be useful for other with basic web dev knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="key-points">Key Points</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll.
    <ul>
      <li>Kramdown with GFM (GitHub Markdown) mode.</li>
      <li>Rouge for syntax highlighting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Adapts perfectly to all screen sizes, without losing consistency of appearance.</li>
  <li>Colours and sizes all edited via variables from master SASS file.
    <ul>
      <li>This means you don’t have to trawl through mile of CSS to edit a colour or size.</li>
      <li>Enforces consistency.</li>
      <li>Easy to flip into a dark or other theme.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Not compatible for generating on GitHub pages (but fine to host on there).
    <ul>
      <li>This makes life a lot easier, less restrictions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tries to follow the <a href="http://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/common/ckeditor/filemanager/userfiles/About_Us/policies/Dyslexia_Style_Guide.pdf">British Dyslexic Association Style Guide</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>I’m not dyslexic but I do find their guidelines rather comfortable.</li>
      <li>This does result in a small sacrifice to style (no justified-text).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="long-version">Long Version</h3>

<p>A long time ago I decided to create a personal blog hosted used GitHub pages.</p>

<p>At first I tried to modify themes made by others; it ended up looking awful and samey, the CSS was hard to reason and horrible to modify.</p>

<p>I saw responsive sites and marvelled at how they changed shape as I shrunk the browser window. 
Then I saw how ridiculous the CSS involved was. 
Then I realised good old word wrap does the job twice as well.</p>

<p>So I set out to write my own CSS and HTML, set  out with the basic template created by Jekyll and created. Create my <a href="http://t3hmun.github.io/rather-simple-jekyll-theme/">Rather Simple Jekyll Theme</a>) but the CSS ended up a mess again - I had hardly written any real HTML or CSS before. I’d tried to work on top of Jekyll’s default theme, which turned out to be less than ideal.</p>

<p>I decided to start again from scratch. So I made this site. Using obsessive documentation to justify everything, I managed to make something much more neat and maintainable. I’ve written the documenting blog posts as tutorials as this approach forces me to properly consider and justify everything I did.</p>
