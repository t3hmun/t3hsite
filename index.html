<!-- 
This page only uses H1; It relies on the HTML5 feature that automaticlly changes H1 according to section nesting.
Each block within the main needs a section to put it at a higher header level than the site title.
-->
<section>
  <h1> Welcome </h1> {{ page.description }}
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Recent Posts</h1>
  <!-- 
  Use Liquid to iterate through the 10 most recent posts in the site.
  The title date and description for each page is also extracted using Liquid. 
  -->

    {% for post in site.posts limit:10 %}

      <!-- 
      The article tag is a sectioning element making the next H1 even smaller.
      Article is used because the title and description could be independently understood.
      -->
      <article>
        <!-- <header> tag should only be used if the header is more than a single <h#> tag. -->
