// The only number that is used outside of this file is zero.

// This is the value that defines the vertical rhythm for the whole document.
// All text sizes (except for the H1 and H2) share this spacing.
// H1 and H2 are too big and have double spacing, hence staying with the rhythm.
// In order to make it consistent it must be a px size.
// Normal zoom works fine with this.
// One compromise is that text-only zoom will be a disaster with this absolute line-height.
$line-height: $base * 1.6;

// Gutter is the space from edge of screen. 
// Fixed to look neat on all sizes without wasting screen space.
// vspace is vertical and should be set to match the line-height in order to cerate a sconsistent vertical rhythm.

// The max width for pure text content.
// I want roughly 60 characters per line for hard reading.
// Normal fonts have a height width raio of around 2.2:1
// The height is multiplied to achieve a rough CPL.
$reading-width: $base * 27;

// This is the max with for any content, including large images, code and titles.
// These kinds of content like to exploit as much space as possible.
// However using more than double the reading width looks clumsy and confusing.

// Other text is things like bullets and blockquotes.
// Bullets enjoy longer lines, better flow, they already have visual aids to help the eye.
// Also gives space for the extra gutter parts of these elements.
