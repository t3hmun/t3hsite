## What

This is documentation of my attempt to make a Jekyll blog-site from scratch, deleting most of the default cruft, justifying every single line for maximum understanding. This is my way of creating a nice theme for my site and learning good HTML5 and CSS/SASS along the way. 

I've attempted to write this like a tutorial to fast-forward people to my level of understanding on these topics. This is not for people who are unfamiliar with code, I expect that one should be able to understand a for loop in a new language without help. Also I expect you can vaguley understand HTML and CSS. This project is about finding out about the important details, nuances that make markup good.

>Although I have a stong belief that a website should properly adapt to any screen type, I am not convinced by the 'responsive design' fad.
A website can adapt perfectly without complicated and wild changes that resposive design seems to involve; it becomes inconsisent and confusing.
A website shouldn't loose features or drastically change it's look and feel just because its a different design.
I'm not interested in playing spot the hidden menu.
Blog sites have no benefit in being as complicated as they are.
For me utility is far more important than popular aesthetics.
Besides popular aesthetics tends to be just looking like everybody else.


## Why?

I have tried modifying the themes made by others but it has never been a satisfying experience.
Most of the CSS/SASS that I have encountered has been no fun to modify, it's impossible to know what the original designer was thinking.
Before long it becomes a impenetrable mess with more quirks than Internet Explorer.
On top of that it simply never feels like my own design, the original template is always echoing.


## Why Jekyll?

* A static blog-site is all I need
* Convenient
* Easy to use

I've already fiddled with Jekyll and it is satisfactory.
I've considered trying other things or even writing my own tool-chain, but that seems excessive; too many higher priority tasks to accomplish.

I should warn that this will not be using versions of Jekyll compatible with GitHub's generator; the site will still work perfectly hosted on GitHub, but generated on your own computer, offline. GitHub compatibility limits the features available. Letting GitHub generate the site for you just creates duplication and confusion, for me it is more difficult. Best to stick with the newest version with least bugs and the most features and flexibility. Control your own tool-chain.
