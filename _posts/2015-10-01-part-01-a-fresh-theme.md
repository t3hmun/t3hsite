## What

This is documentation of my attempt to make a Jekyll blog-site from scratch, deleting most of the default cruft, justifying every single line for maximum understanding. This is my way of creating a nice theme for my site and learning good HTML5 and CSS/SASS along the way. 

The primary purpose of this documentation is to act as a lab book, solidify everything I learn and act as a reference for when I forget. However I've added extra details so that it may server as a tutorial for others who would like to learn in the same comprehensive manner.

I am not convinced by the 'responsive design' fad, however I will be creating a website that perfectly adapts to any device, screen or window size.
Blog sites have no need to be as complicated as they are.
For me utility is far more important than aesthetics.
Besides aesthetics tends to be just looking like everybody else.


## Why?

I have tried modifying the themes made by others but it has never been a satisfying experience.
Most of the CSS/SASS that I have encountered has been no fun to modify, it's impossible to know what the original designer was thinking.
Before long it becomes a impenetrable mess with more quirks than Internet Explorer.
On top of that it simply never feels like my own design, the original template is always echoing.


## Why Jekyll?

* A static blog-site is all I need
* Convenient
* Easy to use

I've already fiddled with Jekyll and it is satisfactory.
I've considered trying other things or even writing my own tool-chain, but that seems excessive; too many higher priority tasks to accomplish.
