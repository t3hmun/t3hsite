	<h3 id="a-quick-primer-on-jekyll">A Quick Primer on Jekyll</h3>

<p>Jekyll is a tool for making static blog sites.
Static means no backing database, just served as files on a server.
Jekyll is nice because it automatically does a bunch with a single command, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Jekyll build</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processes Liquid Markup
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically creates many handy liquid variables</li>
      <li>Used for automatically generating indexes, titles, summaries etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Converts Markdown to HTML
    <ul>
      <li>Write your blog posts in markdown</li>
      <li>Using markdown is easier and less distracting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Processes CSS/SASS
    <ul>
      <li>SASS is a CSS generator, makes CSS maintainable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After a build the generated files can be pasted onto a webserver and job done.</p>

<p>Jekyll also has the handy <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> command that monitors and rebuilds automatically, while hosting the result on a localhost server for viewing.
This means the result of all of the prosessing can be seen immediately.</p>

<h3 id="tooling-up">Tooling Up</h3>

<p><em>This is a Windows 7 installation, but only the Ruby installation is OS specific.</em></p>

<p><em>I always use Git-Bash as my command-line, never windows command prompt.</em></p>

<h4 id="ruby">Ruby</h4>

<p>Jekyll is written in Ruby so it is required.
Acquire latest Ruby and DevKit installers from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">rubyinstaller.org</a>.
I used Ruby 2.2.3 x64, however any new version should work.</p>

<p>Install Ruby to a directory with no white-space in the name (some Ruby packages require this).
Now extract the DevKit to a permanent directory.
This is required for the automatic building of some gems (RubyGems is Rubyâ€™s package manager, a Gem is a package).</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby -v</code> at the command-line should now display the installed version of Ruby.</p>

<p>Next run the install script for the DevKit so that the Ruby installation can use it:</p>

<div class="reading-width highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruby dk.rb init
ruby dk.rb install
</code></pre>
</div>

<h4 id="jekyll-and-friends">Jekyll and Friends</h4>

<p>Install Jekyll and Rouge using the RubyGems. 
Rouge is a syntax highlighter, its installation can be skipped if the abilty to display code/markup is not needed.</p>

<div class="reading-width highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install jekyll
gem install rouge
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="create-a-not-so-fresh-new-jekyll-site">Create a Not So Fresh New Jekyll Site</h3>

<p>Create a new default blog-site with <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll new</code>.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> command builds the site and then hosts the page at <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000</code>.
It automatically rebuilds when changes are made so it can be left running.</p>

<div class="reading-width highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll new site-name
<span class="nb">cd </span>new site-name
jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>View the site in a browser.</p>

<p>This is a good time to make an initial Git commit.</p>

<h4 id="the-yml-config">The YML Config</h4>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file is the basic config for the site. Most of it should be self-explanatory.</p>

<p>Some extra build options are useful to modify the behaviour of the kramdown markdown processor (added to the end of the file).</p>

<div class="reading-width highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="c1"># Build settings</span>
<span class="s">markdown</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">kramdown</span>
<span class="s">kramdown</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="s">input</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">GFM</span>
  <span class="s">syntax_highlighter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">rouge</span>
  <span class="s">hard_wrap</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">false</span>
  <span class="s">header_offset</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">1</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="highlight language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><span class="s">input</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">GFM</span></code></dt>
  <dd>Allows processing of Github Flavored Markdown. Handy as this is the version of Markdown I most commonly use.</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlight language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><span class="s">syntax_highlighter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">rouge</span></code></dt>
  <dd>Use Rouge to process the code blocks. I prefer this to the default (coderay) because it can highlight more things such as bash.</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlight language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><span class="s">hard_wrap</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">true</span></code></dt>
  <dd>This is a personal preference. Tells Kramdown to ignore single new-lines. 
Double new line is a new paragraph.
The only way to get a single new line is to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code>.
This is they way Markdown is meant to behave.</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlight language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><span class="s">header_offset 1</span></code></dt>
  <dd>This reduces the header level used in the markdown by one when converting it to HTML.
This is done to demote the title of the blog post to H2; H1 is only suitable for use once as the site header (explained in detail later).</dd>
